    <h2>Title of this section</h2>
    <p>All eyes were pegged to Nvidia this week as the dominant chip producer’s quarterly earnings provided a healthy dose of suspense… only for a classic feel-good story to emerge Wednesday.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The company’s revenue more than doubled to a record $13.51B in Q2, surpassing Wall Street estimates of $11.19B.</li>
      <li>The chip maker’s earnings per share stood at $2.70, exceeding expectations of $2.08.</li>
      <li>The forecast is even shinier for $16B in revenue in Q3.</li>
      <li>Perspective: Nvidia is valued at $1.16T surpassing the entire crypto sector’s market cap by $0.1T.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nvidia's revenue surge is <a href=''>attributed to heightened demand for AI technology</a> – the company’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for training AI models, e.g. ChatGPT. Currently, the H100, its highest-end AI chip, is in high demand, which in turn makes Nvidia the biggest winner from this year’s boom in the industry.
    The record earnings could have a ripple effect that reaches the crypto mining community, as the latter feels pressure (e.g. energy costs, inflation, and subdued market activity.) You see, Nvidia’s GPUs were the preferred mining equipment for many cryptocurrencies until Ethereum’s switch to Proof-of-Stake introduced new rules and eliminated the need for them.</p>
    <p>Prior to this though, Nvidia experienced a true surge, riding the all-time highs of 2021 with the entire sector. So if the past is anything to go by, could a new synergistic partnership between miners and the company emerge? As AI is <a href=''>the talk of the town in the tech sector</a>, could this be the way ahead to push technological frontiers, the place where it all comes to align for Bitcoin even?
    As AI and blockchain intersect (AI tokens <a href=''>marked gains</a> on the Nvidia news), they could pave the way forward with greater stability, utility, and innovation within the crypto ecosystem, positioning BTC and other digital assets as a true alternative in personal finance.</p>
